# MiniAirbnb

A SwiftUI-based application that allows users to browse and view listings of properties available for rent, emulating a simplified version of the Airbnb platform.

## *Currenty being updated due to ios updates and a change in IPA website*

## Features
- Property Listings: View a list of properties with details such as name, neighborhood, room type, minimum nights required, and price.
- Dynamic Data Fetching: The app fetches data from a public API to display real-time listings.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with SwiftUI to provide a clean and responsive user experience.

## Recent Updates
### API Change
**Currently, the project is being updated to adapt to changes in the Airbnb listings API. The previous API endpoint has been replaced with a different format and fields, leading to the following adjustments being made:**

- **New API Endpoint:** The application now pulls data from the updated API endpoint:
https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/air-bnb-listings/records?limit=100&lang=en&timezone=America%2FNew_York&refine=city%3A%22New-york-city%22&refine=room_type%3A%22Entire%20home%2Fapt%22

- **Updated Data Structure:** The response format has changed, necessitating updates to the data models. Key changes include:
- Removal of fields such as `thumbnail_url`, `listing_url`, and other previous properties that are no longer provided.
- Introduction of new properties like `coordinates`, allowing for geographical representation of listings.

- **Code Refactoring:** The Swift models (`AirbnbListing` and `AirbnbListingCardView`) have been refactored to accommodate the new data structure, ensuring seamless integration and display of updated listings.
