MiniAirbnb

Overview

MiniAirbnb is a SwiftUI-based application that allows users to browse and view listings of properties available for rent, emulating a simplified version of the Airbnb platform. The app fetches property listings from an external API, presenting users with key information about each listing, including the property name, location, pricing, and availability.

Dynamic Data Fetching: The app fetches data from a public API to display real-time listings.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with SwiftUI to provide a clean and responsive user experience.
